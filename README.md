# lazy_vasping

lazy vasping is a _light weight_ approach to automating some things in [VASP](https://www.vasp.at/) with the aim of ensuring consistency between calculations. Predominantely it consists of wrappers for the calculation generatation capability of [pymatgen](https://pymatgen.org/) and the calculation parsing functionality found in pymatgen, and [vasppy](https://github.com/bjmorgan/vasppy).

### TODO:
- check wrangler works
- ~~add job submit script~~
- implement calculation statistics viewer and "calc_obervations" file
